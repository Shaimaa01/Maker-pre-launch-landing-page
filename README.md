# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Frontend Mentor - Maker pre-launch landing page solution

This is a solution to the [Maker pre-launch landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/maker-prelaunch-landing-page-WVZIJtKLd).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! That doesnâ€™t look like an email address"

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to focus on:

Gaining a more in-depth knowledge of JavaScript, especially ES6+ features, asynchronous programming, and design patterns.
